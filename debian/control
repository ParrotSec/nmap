Description: The Network Mapper
 Nmap is a utility for network exploration or security auditing. It
 supports ping scanning (determine which hosts are up), many port
 scanning techniques, version detection (determine service protocols
 and application versions listening behind ports), and TCP/IP
 fingerprinting (remote host OS or device identification). Nmap also
 offers flexible target and port specification, decoy/stealth scanning,
 sunRPC scanning, and more. Most Unix and Windows platforms are
 supported in both GUI and commandline modes. Several popular handheld
 devices are also supported, including the Sharp Zaurus and the iPAQ.

Description: The Network Mapper - result compare utility
 Ndiff is a tool to aid in the comparison of Nmap scans. It takes two
 Nmap XML output files and prints the differences between them them:
 hosts coming up and down, ports becoming open or closed, and things like that.
 It can produce output in human-readable text or machine-readable XML formats.

Description: NMAP netcat reimplementation
 ncat is a reimplementation of Netcat by the NMAP project, providing
 most of the features present in the original implementations, along
 with some new features such as IPv6 and SSL support. Port scanning
 support has been removed.
