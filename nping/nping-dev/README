 The nping-dev directory contains some text files and simple scripts
 which are useful for specific development tasks, such as generating
 getters and setters for various classes, run Nping's test battery, etc.
 It also contains some internal development documents that are still in
 the draft state. 

 Altough the contents of the directory may only be useful for a few
 developers, the files are kept public. However, the files are not
 intended to be used by end-users and therefore, may contain bugs or 
 inaccurate information.
