    <note><para>This document describes the very latest version of
    Zenmap available from <ulink

    <para>Zenmap is a multi-platform graphical Nmap frontend and results viewer.
    Zenmap aims to make Nmap easy for beginners to use while giving experienced
    Nmap users advanced features. Frequently used scans can be saved as profiles
    to make them easy to run repeatedly. A command creator allows interactive
    creation of Nmap command lines. Scan results can be saved and viewed later.
    Saved scan results can be compared with one another to see how they differ.
    The results of recent scans are stored in a searchable database.</para>

    <para>This man page only describes the few Zenmap command-line options and some critical notes.  A much more detailed Zenmap User's Guide is available at <ulink url="https://nmap.org/book/zenmap.html"/>.  Other documentation and information is available from the Zenmap web page at <ulink url="https://nmap.org/zenmap/"/>.</para>

    <title>Bugs</title>
    <para>Like their authors, Nmap and Zenmap aren&rsquo;t perfect.  But you can
    help make them better by sending bug reports or even writing patches.  If
    Nmap or Zenmap doesn&rsquo;t behave the way you expect, first upgrade to the
    latest version available from <ulink url="https://nmap.org"/>.  If
    the problem persists, do some research to determine whether it has already
    been discovered and addressed.  Try Googling the error message or browsing
    the <citetitle>nmap-dev</citetitle> archives at <ulink url="https://seclists.org/" />.
    Read this
    full manual page as well.  If nothing comes of this, mail a bug report to
    <email>dev@nmap.org</email>.  Please include everything you have
    learned about the problem, as well as what version of Zenmap you are running
    and what operating system version it is running on.  Problem reports and
    Zenmap usage questions sent to dev@nmap.org are far more likely to
    be answered than those sent to Fyodor directly.</para>

    <para>Code patches to fix bugs are even better than bug reports. Basic
    instructions for creating patch files with your changes are available at
    <ulink url="https://svn.nmap.org/nmap/HACKING" />.  Patches may be sent
    to <citetitle>nmap-dev</citetitle> (recommended) or to Fyodor directly.</para>

  <refsect1 id='man-history'>
    <title>History</title>

    <para>Zenmap was originally derived from Umit, an Nmap GUI created
    during the Google-sponsored Nmap Summer of Code in 2005 and 2006.
    The primary author of Umit was Adriano Monteiro Marques.  When
    Umit was modified and integrated into Nmap in 2007, it was renamed
    Zenmap.</para>
